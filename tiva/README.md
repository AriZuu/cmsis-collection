There is no good CMSIS available for Texas Instruments
Tiva Cortex-M chips yet (at least I'm not aware of one).
This is a mix of unofficial CMSIS found at

https://github.com/speters/CMSIS

and driverlib found at

https://github.com/antoinealb/Tivaware

Makefile expects to find the downloaded zips (speters-cmsis.zip and
antoinealb-tivaware.zip) from ../distfiles.
